This is a microverse project and it's main objective is to evaluate object oriented programming in ruby. The project consist of two games.

1. Master mind: The game is played in the ruby console against an automated system. In building this game i came across methods such as the random method which i used to build the automation. The game has the ability to ask the players name which it uses to communicate with the player.

2. tic_tac_toe: The game is played in the ruby console as well and demands two users as player1 and player2. Any player who chooses numbers of a winning configuration wins the game while the other loses. The winner is announced at the end of the game as the game exits.

I learnt a lot from this project as far as object oriented programming in ruby is concern. I made use of class definition, object instantiation, using get methods in classes, using instance variables etc.
